# AOSP Camera Fix

Camera Fix for AOSP ROMS, Tested on SAMSUNG N920T.

AOSP = *A*ndroid *O*pen *S*ource *P*roject

Fix for when the camera suddenly stops working or displays an all green/gray/black background. 

 - Should work on all devices of similar kind ROOTED WITH MAGISK.

 - I do not claim responsability for any damage or lost data. Use at your own risk.

 - This will not fix the camera on a single use, you'll have to use it everytime the camera fails.

 - Go to the apk folder and download the .apk file.
